PERSONAL AREA NETWORK (PAN)
  These are personal devices that can communicate in close proximity through wired or wireless networking. 
    Examples include cellphones, wireless mice or keyboards, headphones, even a TV is on a PAN. 
    
LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)
  These are devices on the same network connected via ethernet or wireless.
    Examples include multiple computers in a classroom like Skiff or Foster

A Network is simply two+ computers sharing information. 

WAN is Wide Area Network, the largest network (the internet)

Wireless is the most popular type of network now a days (LinkNYC)

Wireless Mesh Networks are point to point communication like radio and emergency comms

Domains are more robust than Workgroups

Hubs broadcast all information received to all computers on a network, switches are the replacement for hubs because hubs are inefficient

Ethernet has a max length, cannot extend past 327 feet (100m) otherwise data flow becomes unstable

32-bit 
  32-bit Windows can have 32-bit or 64-bit processor
  4GB RAM MAXIMUM, NO EXCEPTIONS
  32-bits processed at a time, hence the name 32-bit
  No Kernal protection
  
64-bit
  64-bit processor only
  up to 2,048 GB RAM supported
  64-bits processed at a time, hence the name 64-bit
  DEP 24/7 protection (Data Execution Prevention)
  
End Of Life Concerns
  When an OS reaches the end of its life cycle, the company stops releasing security updates, and can no longer guarantee future apps will be compatible with the old software
  Too many vulnerabilities will start to appear, will cost too much to continue to operate at the same level of security. 
  
 Update Concerns are usually about insufficient hardware or incompatible hardware. Newer softwares require newer hardware.
 
 Forward compatibility is when a manufacturer allows an extension for newer softwares of the same kind, such as Windows 7 and Windows 10. An extensible system can be upgraded with newer hardware as well.
 
You can organize the options by icon size

Windows Registry
  The registry contains such things as folder and file property settings, port configuration, application preferences, and user profiles.
  The 5 subtrees are:
  
   Hkey_Local_Machine: Holds global hardware configuration. Included in the branch is a list of hardware components installed in the computer, the software drivers that handle each component, and the settings for each device. This information is not user specific.
   
   Hkey_Users: Keeps track of individual users and their preferences.
   
   Hkey_Current_User: Holds a specific userâ€™s configuration, such as software settings, how the desktop appears, and what folders the user has created.
   
   Hkey_Current_Config: Holds information about the hardware profile that is used when the computer first boots.
   
   Hkey_Classes_Root: Holds file associations and file links. The information held here is what allows the correct application to start when you double-click a filename in Windows Explorer/File Explorer or My Computer/Computer (provided that the file extension is registered).

Server-based network is where there is a main server computer, this computer is more powerful than the average home computer and can support hosting multiple other computer nodes on the network.

Workgroups are when computers create a virtual link between eachother and share information without the moderation of a central host/server computer.

Types of cables

  Twisted-Pair cables are as they sound, twisted. They can be shielded (STP) or unshielded (UTP). Shielded just provides an extra layer of foil to protect the cables
  Plenum cables are less of a firerisk
  
OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) Model

  Layer 1 (PHYSICAL)
  Layer 2 (DATA LINK)
  Layer 3 (NETWORK)
  Layer 4 (TRANSPORT)
  Layer 5 (SESSION)
  Layer 6 (PRESENTATION)
  Layer 7 (APPLICATION)

  C.I.A.
    C - Confidentiality
    I - Integrity
    A - Availability
  
  Destory physical documents after they are no longer needed, to maintain privacy 
  
  Be thorough with planning for disaster and breaches. Make sure there are proceedures in place for handling information and what to do if information is compromised.
  
  Security features you could implement for wifi security can help encrypt your web traffic, hide your IPs, and restrict network access among other things. Using firewall policies that limit malicious IPs, prevent unvalidated input from being passed through to the network, and implementing Access Control rules can really help secure your data from every day attacks. Also blocking port 3306, because that is the port that MySql runs on and blocking the port effecitvely blocks the attack.
